# Optimizing Store Placement using Geospatial Clustering and Sales Data

**Overview:**

This project analyzes geospatial data and sales performance to identify optimal locations for new stores and suggest improvements to existing store portfolios.  The analysis utilizes geospatial clustering techniques to identify areas with high customer density and strong sales potential, while considering the current distribution of existing stores. This allows for data-driven decision-making in retail expansion and optimization strategies.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python 3
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn (for clustering algorithms)
* Geopandas (for geospatial data manipulation)


**How to Run:**

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Then, install the required Python libraries listed above using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   The script will process the input data (assumed to be in the specified format within the project), perform the geospatial analysis, and generate the output.


**Example Output:**

The script will print key findings to the console, including:

* Summary statistics of sales data and customer demographics.
* Details of identified clusters and their characteristics (e.g., centroid coordinates, number of stores, average sales).
* Recommendations for new store locations and potential adjustments to existing store portfolios.

Additionally, the script will generate several plot files (e.g., `cluster_map.png`, `sales_distribution.png`) visualizing the geospatial clustering results and sales data. These plots provide a visual representation of the analysis and its findings.  The exact filenames and types of plots may vary depending on the specific analysis performed.


**Data:**

The project requires input data in a specific format (details to be added in a separate data description file).  Please ensure your data adheres to this format before running the script.


**Further Development:**

Future improvements could include incorporating additional data sources (e.g., competitor locations, traffic patterns), exploring more advanced clustering algorithms, and developing a user interface for easier interaction with the analysis.
