# --- 4.  Recommendations (Illustrative) ---
#  Based on cluster analysis, suggest new store locations or adjustments to existing ones.
# This section needs further development based on the specific business goals and cluster analysis.
print("\nIllustrative Recommendations (Requires further analysis):")
#Example: Identify clusters with high customer density and relatively low sales as potential locations for new stores.
#Example: Identify clusters with low customer density and high sales as potential areas for marketing campaigns.
#Note: This is a simplified example.  A real-world analysis would involve more sophisticated clustering techniques, consideration of competition, market saturation, and other relevant factors.  Error handling and more robust data validation would also be crucial in a production environment.
